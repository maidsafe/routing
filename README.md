###Pre-requisite:
libsodium is a native dependency for [sodiumxoide](https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide). Thus, install sodium by following the instructions [here](http://doc.libsodium.org/installation/README.html).

For windows, download and use the [prebuilt mingw library](https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.2-mingw.tar.gz).
Extract and place the libsodium.a file in "bin\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu" for 64bit System or "bin\i686-pc-windows-gnu" for a 32bit system.

SQLite3 is also native dependency for [rustsqlite](https://github.com/linuxfood/rustsqlite).
Steps to compile SQLite by,
1. Download SQLite Source code which includes a "configure" script from [SQLite download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) 
2. On Linux, Run `./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install` to build the SQLite source. While on Windows Users can build using (mingw + msys) and run './configure && make' 
3. On Windows, Copy the `libsqlite3.a` file from the .libs folder to the "bin\{TARGET-TRIPLE}" in the project root folder.
