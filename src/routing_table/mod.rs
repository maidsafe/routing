// A routing table to manage contacts for a node in a [Kademlia][1] distributed hash table.
//
// [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia
//
//
// This uses the Kademlia mechanism for routing messages in a peer-to-peer network, and generalises
// it to provide redundancy in every step: for senders, messages in transit and receivers.
// It contains the routing table and the functionality to decide via which of its entries to route
// a message, but not the networking functionality itself.
//
// It also provides methods to decide which other nodes to connect to, depending on a parameter
// `bucket_size` (see below).
//
//
// # Addresses and distance functions
//
// Nodes in the network are addressed with a [`Xorable`][2] type, an unsigned integer with `B` bits.
// The *[XOR][3] distance* between two nodes with addresses `x` and `y` is `x ^ y`. This
// [distance function][4] has the property that no two points ever have the same distance from a
// given point, i. e. if `x ^ y == x ^ z`, then `y == z`. This property allows us to define the
// `k`-*close group* of an address as the `k` closest nodes to that address, guaranteeing that the
// close group will always have exactly `k` members (unless, of course, the whole network has less
// than `k` nodes).
//
// [2]: trait.Xorable.html
// [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation
// [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_%28mathematics%29
//
// The routing table is associated with a node with some name `x`, and manages a number of contacts
// to other nodes, sorting them into up to `B` *buckets*, depending on their XOR distance from `x`:
//
// * If 2<sup>`B`</sup> > `x ^ y` >= 2<sup>`B - 1`</sup>, then y is in bucket 0.
// * If 2<sup>`B - 1`</sup> > `x ^ y` >= 2<sup>`B - 2`</sup>, then y is in bucket 1.
// * If 2<sup>`B - 2`</sup> > `x ^ y` >= 2<sup>`B - 3`</sup>, then y is in bucket 2.
// * ...
// * If 2 > `x ^ y` >= 1, then y is in bucket `B - 1`.
//
// Equivalently, `y` is in bucket `n` if the longest common prefix of `x` and `y` has length `n`,
// i. e. the first binary digit in which `x` and `y` disagree is the `(n + 1)`-th one. We call the
// length of the remainder, without the common prefix, the *bucket distance* of `x` and `y`. Hence
// `x` and `y` have bucket distance `B - n` if and only if `y` belongs in bucket number `n`.
//
// The bucket distance is coarser than the XOR distance: Whenever the bucket distance from `y` to
// `x` is less than the bucket distance from `z` to `x`, then `y ^ x < z ^ x`. But not vice-versa:
// Often `y ^ x < z ^ x`, even if the bucket distances are equal. The XOR distance ranges from 0
// to 2<sup>`B`</sup> (exclusive), while the bucket distance ranges from 0 to `B` (inclusive).
//
//
// # Guarantees
//
// The routing table provides functions to decide, for a message with a given destination, which
// nodes in the table to pass the message on to, so that it is guaranteed that:
//
// * If the destination is the address of a node, the message will reach that node after at most
//   `B - 1` hops.
// * Otherwise, if the destination is a `k`-close group with `k <= bucket_size`, the message will
//   reach every member of the `k`-close group of the destination address, i. e. all `k` nodes in
//   the network that are XOR-closest to that address, and each node knows whether it belongs to
//   that group.
// * Each node in a given address' close group is connected to each other node in that group. In
//   particular, every node is connected to its own close group.
// * The number of total hop messages created for each message is at most `B`.
// * For each node there are at most `B * bucket_size` other nodes in the network that would
//   accept a connection, at any point in time. All other nodes do not need to disclose their IP
//   address.
// * There are `bucket_size` different paths along which a message can be sent, to provide
//   redundancy.
//
// However, to be able to make these guarantees, the routing table must be filled with sufficiently
// many contacts. Specifically, the following invariant must be ensured:
//
// > Whenever a bucket `n` has fewer than `bucket_size` entries, it contains *all* nodes in the
// > network with bucket distance `B - n`.
//
// The user of this crate therefore needs to make sure that whenever a node joins or leaves, all
// affected nodes in the network update their routing tables accordingly.
//
//
// # Resilience against malfunctioning nodes
//
// The sender may choose to send a message via up to `bucket_size` distinct paths to provide
// redundancy against malfunctioning hop nodes. These paths are likely, but not guaranteed, to be
// disjoint.
//
// The concept of close groups exists to provide resilience even against failures of the source or
// destination itself: If every member of a group tries to send the same message, it will arrive
// even if some members fail. And if a message is sent to a whole group, it will arrive in most,
// even if some of them malfunction.
//
// Close groups can thus be used as inherently redundant authorities in the network that messages
// can be sent to and received from, using a consensus algorithm: A message from a group authority
// is considered to be legitimate, if a majority of group members have sent a message with the same
// content.
