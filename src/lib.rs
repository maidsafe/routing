//! Client and node implementations for a resilient decentralised network.
//!
//! The network is based on the [`kademlia_routing_table`][1] and uses the XOR metric to define the
//! "distance" between two [`XorName`][2]s. `XorName`s are used as addresses of nodes, clients as
//! well as data.
//!
//! [1]: ../kademlia_routing_table/index.html
//! [2]: ../xor_name/struct.XorName.html
//!
//! Messages are exchanged between _authorities_, where an `Authority` can be an
//! individual client or node, or a group of nodes. In both cases, messages are cryptographically
//! signed by the sender, and in the latter case it is verified that a sufficient number of group
//! members agree on the message: Only if that quorum is reached, the message is delivered. In
//! addition, each message has a unique ID, and is delivered only once.
//!
//! Group authorities are also addressed using a single `XorName`. The members of that group are
//! the nodes that are closest to that name. Since nodes are assigned their name by the network,
//! this provides redundancy and resilience: A node has no control over which group authorities it
//! will be a member of, and without a majority in the group it cannot forge a message from that
//! group.
//!
//! The library also provides different types for the messages' data.
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! A decentralised service based on the `routing` library uses `Client` to send requests to the
//! network of nodes and receive responses.
//!
//! `Node` is used to handle and send requests within that network, and to implement its
//! functionality, e. g. storing and retrieving data, validating permissions, managing metadata etc.
//!
//!
//! ## Client creation
//!
//! A client's name is a hash of its public keys. Upon creation, the client will attempt to connect
//! to the network through any node, and exchange public keys with it. That node becomes a
//! bootstrap node for the client, and messages to and from the client will be routed over it.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::mpsc;
//! use routing::{Client, Event, FullId};
//!
//! let (sender, _receiver) = mpsc::channel::<Event>();
//! let full_id = FullId::new(); // Generate new keys.
//! let _ = Client::new(sender, Some(full_id.clone())).unwrap();
//!
//! let _ = full_id.public_id().name();
//! ```
//!
//! Messages can be sent using the methods of `client`, and received as `Event`s from the
//! `receiver`.
//!
//!
//! ## Node creation
//!
//! Creating a node looks even simpler:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::mpsc;
//! use routing::{Node, Event};
//!
//! let (sender, _receiver) = mpsc::channel::<Event>();
//! let first_node = false;
//! let _ = Node::new(sender, first_node).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Upon creation, the node will first connect to the network as a client. Once it has client
//! status, it requests a new name from the network, and then integrates itself in the network with
//! that new name, adding close nodes to its routing table.
//!
//! Messages can be sent using the methods of `node`, and received as `Event`s from the `receiver`.
//! The node can act as an individual node or as part of a group authority. Sending a message as a
//! group authority only has an effect if sufficiently many other nodes in that authority send the
//! same message.
//!
