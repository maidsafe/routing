/// Holds the current state and handles state transitions.
///
/// # The bootstrap process
///
///
/// ## Bootstrapping a client
///
/// A newly created `Core`, A, starts in `Disconnected` state and tries to establish a connection to
/// any node B of the network via Crust. When successful, i. e. when receiving an `OnConnect` event,
/// it moves to the `Bootstrapping` state.
///
/// A now sends a `ClientIdentify` message to B, containing A's signed public ID. B verifies the
/// signature and responds with a `BootstrapIdentify`, containing B's public ID and the current
/// quorum size. Once it receives that, A goes into the `Client` state and uses B as its proxy to
/// the network.
///
/// A can now exchange messages with any `Authority`. This completes the bootstrap process for
/// clients.
///
///
/// ## Becoming a node
///
/// If A wants to become a full routing node (`client_restriction == false`), it needs to relocate,
/// i. e. change its name to a value chosen by the network, and then add its peers to its routing
/// table and get added to their routing tables.
///
///
/// ### Getting a new network name from the `NaeManager`
///
/// Once in `Client` state, A sends a `GetNodeName` request to the `NaeManager` group authority X
/// of A's current name. X computes a new name and sends it in an `ExpectCloseNode` request to  the
/// `NaeManager` Y of A's new name. Each member of Y caches A's public ID, and Y sends a
/// `GetNodeName` response back to A, which includes the public IDs of the members of Y.
///
///
/// ### Connecting to the close group
///
/// To the `ManagedNode` for each public ID it receives from members of Y, A sends its
/// `ConnectionInfo`. It also caches the ID.
///
/// For each `ConnectionInfo` that a node Z receives from A, it decides whether it wants A in its
/// routing table. If yes, and if A's ID is in its ID cache, Z sends its own `ConnectionInfo` back
/// to A and also attempts to connect to A via Crust. A does the same, once it receives the
/// `ConnectionInfo`.
///
/// Once the connection between A and Z is established and a Crust `OnConnect` event is raised,
/// they exchange `NodeIdentify` messages and add each other to their routing tables. When A
/// receives its first `NodeIdentify`, it finally moves to the `Node` state.
